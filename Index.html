                <p>Hi, I’m Frederich de Koker — a recent Computer Science graduate, rugby player, and passionate
                    developer with a love for building clean, useful, and human-centered apps.</p>
                <p>Originally from South Africa, I came to the U.S. to study and expand my opportunities in tech. Since
                    then, I’ve worked on everything from fitness tracking apps to large-scale group projects like
                    Drinksity, a beverage passport app built using SwiftUI and Firebase. I’m especially interested in
                    full-stack development, with experience across Swift, React, Java, and cloud services like AWS.</p>
                <p>Right now, I’m looking for a role where I can grow as a software engineer, keep learning, and
                    contribute to projects that make a difference—big or small. When I’m not coding, you can usually
                    find me at the gym, on a bike ride, or diving into my next personal project.</p>
